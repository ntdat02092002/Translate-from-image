# Translate-from-image

## Introduction
The problem of combining object detection and object recognition is a difficult problem, as both object detection and object recognition methods must be combined. That's why in this repo we want to challenge ourselves with an application that can both detect text and recognize detected text areas. In addition, to make the problem more challenging, we also use a machine translation model.

In this application we use CRAFT for text detection, TRBA model for text recognition and Transformer model for text translation from English to Vietnamese.
